### Welcome to Stephanie Bouasy's Portfolio!

This is where all my projects created during the SMU fullstack webdevelopment bootcamp can be viewed.

## Node-Js Homework

In this assignment we created a LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

The LIRI can be viewed from here:

## Trivia Game

Test your Harry Potter knowledge by taking this timed trivia quiz! In this assignment I created a Trivia game, using JavaScript for the logic, and jQuery to manipulate HTML. I also laid out this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.

## Word Guess Game

Play the classic Hangman game with a Stranger Things twist. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code.
